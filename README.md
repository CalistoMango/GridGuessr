# 🏎️ GridGuessr

**GridGuessr** is a Farcaster Mini App.  
Each race week, you can predict what will happen on track — from pole position to fastest lap — and climb the leaderboard as the season unfolds.  

Built on **Base** and **Farcaster**, GridGuessr brings the thrill of race weekends onchain.

## 🎮 How it works

Before each Grand Prix:
- Make your predictions — pole, podium, fastest lap, first DNF, safety car, and more.  
- Picks lock when qualifying starts.  
- After the race, scores are updated automatically and leaderboards refresh.  

You can then share your results directly into Farcaster — show off your streaks, badges, and bragging rights 🏁
